Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowers the AI design process. Then, how do consumers respond to AIdesigned fashion products? Building on schema theory, this research investigated the extent to which AIdesigned clothing is perceived as authentic through three online experiments. Study 1 (n = 121) and Study 2
(n = 161) showed consumers generally respond more favorably to human-designed (vs. AI-designed) clothing,
which is driven by perceived authenticity and expected product quality. Study 3 (n = 156) confirmed that
negative responses toward AI-designed clothing can be mitigated when consumers have the option to provide
input to customize the design because it enhances perceived authenticity. Study findings offer a theoretical
understanding of how and why consumers respond to AI-designed products and practical guidelines for retailers.

1. Introduction
The retail industry is experiencing unparalleled transformation
accelerated by the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
computing efficiency. A promising area of AI applications is fashion
design. In the AI-assisted design process, designers can develop new
designs inspired by the future fashion trends predicted by AI-powered
search engines (Harreis et al., 2023). Furthermore, the recent growth
of generative AI powered by advanced machine learning and easier
access to big data opened the door for companies for AI-driven fashion
design. Generative AI refers to the AI techniques and models that learn a
representation of objects in input data and generate new, original output
that keeps the identity of the original data (Murphy, 2022). Leveraging
the power of generative AI to create thousands of renderings, companies
have recently started to use AI to understand customer needs and design
better-suited apparel items with increased efficiency (Figoli et al., 2022;
Lee, 2022). For example, Acne Studio showcased AI-assisted fashion
designs for its ready-to-wear collection in Paris Fashion Week 2020. Levi
Strauss & Co. used AI algorithms to create new design alternatives for
denim jackets as well as to optimize their production and manufacturing
processes.
While AI in the fashion design process is becoming more prevalent,
not many studies have been conducted focusing on the way AI in the
design process affects consumers’ perception of the product and the

subsequent evaluation. While a few studies investigated consumer re­
sponses to AI versus human design, a consensual agreement building on
theoretical knowledge of how people evaluate AI-designed fashion
products has not been sufficiently made. Furthermore, because con­
sumer responses to AI design technology are yet underresearched from
various perspectives, plenty of room remains to investigate how and
why generative AI in the fashion design process impacts consumers’
product and brand evaluation.
To fill the research gap, this study aims to advance the understanding
of how people evaluate AI-designed fashion products. Specifically,
under the framework of schema theory and the authenticity literature,
three online experiments examined consumer responses to fashion
products designed by AI by comparing those designed by a human
designer. In addition, the mediation of perceived authenticity and ex­
pected product quality was tested to see if they explain the effect of
design entity (AI vs. human) on consumer responses. Lastly, the role of
AI customization that changes consumer responses to fashion products
designed by AI is examined.
Investigating consumer evaluation of AI-designed fashion products is
timely and crucial. The recent interest in generative AI (e.g., GPT-X,
Midjourney, DALL⋅E) is incredibly surging due to technological prog­
ress, and empirical findings on consumer responses to generative AI in
fashion design are essential to help establish the direction of the relevant
business strategies. From the schema theory perspective, the findings of

the three online experiments provide important theoretical and practical
implications by enlightening why and how consumers form particular
responses to fashion products designed by AI, compared to humandesigned (Study 1, Study 2) and AI customization (Study 3). Conse­
quently, the study findings offer implications for practitioners seeking
strategies to interact with consumers about generative AI usage in their
design process.

consumers are willing to pay more for AI-designed (vs. human-designed)
products because of curiosity. More recently, Pieconka (2023) found
that consumers are less willing to pay for AI-designed products because
of little personal benefits from already finalized AI-designed products.

2. Literature review & hypotheses development

This study draws from schema theory to conceptualize the effect of
design entity (AI vs. human) on consumer responses. Schema theory
explains that people categorize information in schemata, which are
memory-stored cognitive frameworks that represent the organization of
their background knowledge or experience for specific domains (Fiske,
1982). Schemata facilitate people’s decision-making processes as newly
incoming information is processed in an individual’s perception based
on existing schema (Bem, 1981). That is, people retrieve information
and categorize new input based on their expectations about a particular
domain (Davvetas and Diamantopoulos, 2016; Sujan and Bettman,
1989). People may have schemata of AI that has a low ability to possess
artistic intention and create artwork, which may affect their responses to
AI-created artwork (Chamberlain et al., 2018; Hong and Curran, 2019).
Consumers’ perceptions of products and brands are significantly
affected by schemata (Davvetas and Diamantopoulos, 2016; Lee and
Kim, 2022; Meyers-Levy and Tybout, 1989). When consumers view
product information from retailers or brands, they use previously
accumulated relevant knowledge to interpret the information. The
activated schemata settle the initial configuration of defining or evalu­
ating the products or brands. When new product information is consis­
tent with an individual’s preexisting schema, the information is easily
processed and often leads to a basic sense of liking without evoking
fluctuating responses toward the product (Halkias and Kokkinaki,
2014). Similarly, an individual may assimilate or accommodate the in­
formation which moderately diverges from the previous knowledge and
modify existing schemata (Mandler, 1981), and such experiences can
positively influence the evaluation of the stimuli (Meyers-Levy and
Tybout, 1989). In contrast, new product or brand information that
highly conflicts with one’s schema prevents the individual from being
willing to accommodate and thus evokes reactance and negative eval­
uation (Boush and Loken, 1991; Halkias and Kokkinaki, 2014; Mandler,
1981).
Using the schema theory as the theoretical base, the next sections
describe consumers’ perceptions of AI as a design entity, which repre­
sents discrepant information from people’s existing schemata. Specif­
ically, the subsequent evaluations of the AI-designed clothing are

2.2. Schema theory

2.1. AI in fashion design process
AI allows companies to collect and analyze massive amounts of sales
and consumer data. By leveraging such capabilities, companies utilize
various AI-powered techniques including virtual agents and personal­
ized services to offer better customer experience (Alimamy and Kuhail,
2023; Kim et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023). Furthermore,
generative AI creates new image-based outputs contingent on input data
or prompts, bringing about innovations in fashion design. GAN-based
models such as a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) can synthesize
design sketches, garment patterns, and texture information to generate
realistic design alternatives (Guo et al., 2023; Xian et al., 2018; Yan
et al., 2022). After input data, such as previous company designs,
budget, materials, and design features, is entered, algorithms generate,
evaluate, refine, and optimize design alternatives. The design outputs
can then be evaluated and regenerated by modifying the input data or
fine-tuning the algorithm models. Fig. 1 illustrates the AI-assisted design
process. Fashion brands can use AI to produce new profitable designs
with enhanced time and labor efficiency while identifying market trends
and patterns (Figoli et al., 2022; Harreis et al., 2023; Lee, 2022).
While the studies on people’s perceptions of AI-generated creative
works mainly focused on text-based or non-commercial arts (see Ap­
pendix A for review), only a few studies have investigated how con­
sumers respond to AI-designed fashion products. Some focused on
consumer evaluation and attitude toward the products. In a seminal
work, Lee (2022) confirmed that human-generated fashion design is
more favorably evaluated than AI-generated design. Similarly, Xu and
Mehta (2022) demonstrated that consumers form more negative brand
attitudes toward AI-designed (vs. human-designed) luxury products due
to perceived brand essence, especially for fashion. Others focused more
on willingness to pay, resulting in mixed findings. Sohn et al. (2020)
confirmed that young consumers are more willing to pay for
GAN-generated fashion design. Zhang et al. (2022) found that

quality judgments about the product (Rao and Monroe, 1989). Impor­
tantly, research has found that consumers’ authenticity attribution
positively affects the quality perception of stimuli (Cinelli and LeBoeuf,
2020; Moulard et al., 2016). For example, Cinelli and LeBoeuf (2020)
confirmed that the intrinsic motivation of a firm for producing products
increases anticipated product quality via perceived authenticity. Such a
relationship between perceived authenticity and product quality is
attributed to the perception of quality commitment, which is one of the
dimensions of perceived authenticity (Gilmore and Pine, 2007; Napoli
et al., 2014). Consumers are likely to perceive higher authenticity from a
product as they believe a quality commitment has been made to the
product. Consequently, perceived quality of the product is enhanced,
ultimately increasing positive consumer responses.
Extending such reasoning based on the literature to AI-designed
clothing, perceived authenticity and expected product quality are
likely to explain the negative responses to AI-designed fashion. The
product designed by genuine and passionate human designers compared
to AI will be deemed to be of quality commitment in overall product
design and thus more authentic. Given that the perceptions of dedication
to design are the critical determinant for assessing designed product
quality (Zhu et al., 2009), the clothing with a higher expected quality
commitment will be considered to be high quality.

proposed to be explained by perceived authenticity and expected
product quality.
2.3. Perceived authenticity and consumer responses toward AI-designed
clothing
This study proposes that information about design entity, either AI or
humans, serves as the critical determinant that affects perceived product
authenticity. Authenticity is defined as what is genuine, real, true, and
unique (Beverland and Farrelly, 2010; Moulard et al., 2014). Consumers
perceive specific levels of authenticity from products along various di­
mensions, including product information, influencer characteristics,
advertising messages, production methods, materials, origins, and con­
nections to firm value (Audrezet et al., 2020; Campagna et al., 2023;
Newman and Dhar, 2014). When authenticity is perceived based on
whether a product is made with the appropriate techniques and pro­
cesses or whether a passionate creator makes a product, they are also
known as craft authenticity and artist authenticity (Littrell et al., 1993;
Moulard et al., 2014), respectively. For example, a souvenir product is
perceived to be highly authentic if it is associated with uniqueness,
workmanship, artistry, aesthetics, and cultural and historical integrity.
Perceived authenticity has been found to positively affect consumer
responses, such as overall product valuation (Newman and Dhar, 2014)
and attitudes toward the products or brands and purchase intention
(Carsana and Jolibert, 2018; Moulard et al., 2014; Napoli et al., 2014).
It is expected that the discrepancy between people’s preexisting
fashion design schema and AI (vs. humans) is large that perceived
authenticity is lowered from AI-designed fashion products than humandesigned ones. Fashion design has been conventionally considered a
human-dominant area. People expect fashion design elements to
encompass designers’ intentions, knowhows, personal characteristics,
and sophisticated skills (Lamb and Kallal, 1992). This implies that
fashion design schemata are associated with human work and charac­
teristics. In contrast, AI as a design entity in fashion represents the in­
formation that highly conflicts with the existing schemata, considering
the long history of intersection between humans and fashion design
works and the relevant schemata. Generative AI is developed to create
original content, but it is true that many people question the reliability
and authenticity of the output from AI (Bang et al., 2023; Harper, 2023),
which potentially indicates low perceived authenticity. Because gener­
ative AI is trained on data lakes and question snippets to create content
responding to prompts, the originality of the content creation is often
doubted (Appel et al., 2023). While no research empirically tested the
authenticity perception of AI-generated design, Jago (2019) showed
that algorithm-made decisions across domains are perceived to be low in
authenticity and sincerity and thus less favored, compared to human
decisions. Such a pattern is predicted to be amplified for fashion design
because fashion is especially considered to be the domain where the
importance of the human touch cannot be overlooked. Thus, consumers
will perceive higher authenticity from human-designed clothing
compared to AI-designed clothing, which enhance consumers’ favorable
responses.

H3. Perceived authenticity and expected product quality will serially
explain the negative responses to AI-designed (vs. human-designed)
clothing.
2.5. The role of AI customization

H1. Consumers will form more favorable responses (i.e., attitude and
purchase intention) toward human-designed clothing than AI-designed
clothing.

How can consumers’ negative responses to AI-designed clothing be
mitigated? This study proposes that real-time customization in AI design
process will change the extent to which consumers perceive authenticity
from AI-designed clothing, and in turn, reduce negative responses. Based
on the existing literature and available technologies (Aggarwal et al.,
2020; Harreis et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2022), AI customization is
conceptualized as the process through which consumers provide input to
personalize their products in real-time based on particular design com­
ponents and AI generates designs to actualize customization accord­
ingly. Mass customization in product design utilizes flexible
computer-aided systems. The benefits of mass customization have
been well documented. Key market performance metrics such as sales
revenues and gross margin, as well as consumer evaluations, outperform
when product design pipelines encompass customer involvement
(Moreau and Herd, 2010; Nishikawa et al., 2013; Stevens et al., 2017).
Furthermore, a positive connection between personalization and
authenticity is speculated in that both draw favorable consumer atti­
tudes and intentions toward AI, as implied in the literature (Alimamy
and Kuhail, 2023; Chu et al., 2022). For example, Alimamy and Kuhail
(2023) found that both perceived authenticity and personalization of a
virtual assistant predict consumer commitment and trust. When it comes
to AI design process, AI customization is likely to increase perceived
authenticity by inducing the values of mass customization and enhanced
benefits of real-time personalization. Therefore, it is expected that the
negative effect of AI as a design entity on perceived authenticity will be
alleviated by AI customization, consequently mitigating the negative
responses to AI-designed clothing.

H2. Perceived authenticity will explain the negative responses to AIdesigned (vs. human-designed) clothing.

H4. AI customization will mitigate the negative effect of AI as design
entity on consumer responses (i.e., attitude and purchase intention).

2.4. Perceived authenticity and expected product quality

3. Research model & overview of the studies

If perceived authenticity on the basis of one’s schemata of AI explains
why consumers would respond differently to human-designed versus AIdesigned clothing, consumer expectations of product quality will likely
serve as the second serial mediator. Consumers rely on extrinsic signals
such as product information, warranty, or brand reputation to make

potheses. As a scenario-based experiment using real brand names, Study

design entity (AI vs. human) affects product attitude and purchase
intention (H1) and whether perceived authenticity mediates such an
effect (H2). Study 2 replicated Study 1 using stimuli of a product image
and a fictitious brand name. Further, Study 2 examined whether
perceived authenticity and expected product quality serially explain the
effects of design entity (H3). Lastly, Study 3 explored the role of AI
customization by testing whether AI design process with versus without
customization features affects product attitude, brand attitude, and
purchase intention (H4). The mediations of perceived authenticity (H2)
and the authenticity–product quality chain (H3) explaining the miti­
gating effect of AI customization were also tested in Study 3. The study
design, data analysis, results, and discussion of each study are described
below.

and completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire including the
shopping scenarios in an online repository and a diagrammatic repre­
sentation of study procedure are available in Appendix D.
Shopping scenarios manipulated the design entity (AI vs. human). In
addition, two different brand types were used in the scenarios as brand
replicates to see if the effect of design entity holds across the brands.
Based on the previous literature on brand type (Mitchell and Balabanis,
2021), Louis Vuitton and H&M were used to represent different brand
types. Design entity and brand replicates were manipulated using a
brand sweater scenario. A sweater was used in the scenario to rule out
potential confounding effects, as past literature indicates that the
conceptualization of a sweater is well-defined, consistent among various
people, and stable over time (DeLong et al., 1986).

replicates.
MANCOVA was performed with design entity and brand replicates as
independent variables and perceived authenticity, product attitude, and
purchase intention as dependent variables. Both brand familiarity and
brand attitude showed significant correlations with the dependent var­
iables, showing suitability as potential covariates. Next, while brand
familiarity did not significantly affect dependent variables (p = .076),
brand attitude showed a significant effect (p < .001) and thus was
entered as a covariate. The statistical assumptions were checked, and the
results showed the appropriateness of the methods used (see Appendix
F). The main effect of design entity on the dependent variables was
significant (Pillai’s Λ = 0.16, Wilks’ λ = 0.84, p < .001, partial η2 =
0.16) whereas brand replicates did not show a significant effect (p =
.151). The design entity × brand replicate interaction effect was not
significant (p = .415). The results remained the same sans the covariate
in that nonsignificant and significant effects hold with and without the
covariate, which supports the robustness of the findings (see Appendix G
for the results without covariates). The subsequent ANCOVA showed
participants perceived higher authenticity from human-designed (vs. AIdesigned) sweater (MAI = 5.06 vs. Mhuman = 5.97; F = 18.81, p < .001,
η2 = 0.14). Participants in the human condition showed more favorable
attitudes (MAI = 5.72 vs. Mhuman = 6.17; F = 5.18, p = .025, η2 = 0.04)
and marginally higher purchase intention (MAI = 5.17 vs. Mhuman =
5.67; F = 3.67, p = .058, η2 = 0.03). Thus, H1 was supported.

4.1.2. Measurements
The multi-item scales were drawn from the existing literature and
modified to fit the context. The measurement items for the main vari­
ables, item wise descriptive, and Cronbach’s alpha scores are presented
in Table 1. Participants’ responses to multi-item scales for a construct
were averaged to calculate an index score. Perceived authenticity was
measured using five items derived from Beverland and Farrelly’s (2010)
study. Product attitude was measured using three items from Chae and
Hoegg’s (2013) study and purchase intention was measured with four
items developed by Dodds et al. (1991). Brand luxuriousness (main­
stream–luxury; Moreau et al., 2020) and reputation (bad reputation–good
reputation; Chaudhuri, 2002) were measured on 7-point semantic scale
items from the literature to ensure whether the two brands represent
different types. Harman’s one-factor test was used to test common
method bias. The total variance extracted by one factor using the 32
items was 38.68%. As the threshold indicating common method bias is
50% (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986), common method bias was not a
major concern.

4.2.3. Mediation
PROCESS macro version 4.2 in SPSS was used for mediation analysis.
The evidence of a significant indirect effect is provided if the 95%
bootstrap confidence intervals do not contain zero. Model 4 (5000
bootstrapped samples) was performed to test the mediation of perceived
authenticity between design entity and the dependent variables while
controlling brand attitude. As hypothesized, the indirect effects of
design entity on product attitude (b = 0.57, 95% bootstrap CI = [0.2483,
0.9334]) and purchase intention (b = 0.81, CI = [0.4382, 1.2041])
through perceived authenticity were significant. The direct effect of
design entity on product attitude (p = .448) and purchase intention (p =
.139) became insignificant when perceived authenticity was entered as a
mediator, suggesting the full mediation of perceived authenticity on the
effect of design entity and the two dependent variables. Thus, H2 was
supported.

4.1.3. Covariates
Potential covariates were selected a priori based on the literature
review and the study design. Given that real brands were used in Study
1, brand attitude (negative–positive) and familiarity (unfamiliar–familiar)
were measured on 7-point semantic scale items as potential covariates.
This was because the literature suggested neutralizing the confounding
effects of existing brands by controlling for familiarity or previous
experience with and general attitude toward existing brands (Geuens
and De Pelsmacker, 2017; Ha et al., 2019).

4.3. Discussion
Study 1 confirmed that consumers more favorably respond to and are
slightly more willing to purchase clothing designed by humans than by
AI (H1). Such an effect was significant across the brand replicates in
Study 1. Also, Study 1 provided initial evidence for the mediating effect
of perceived authenticity (H2). Compared to human-designed clothing,
AI-designed clothing was perceived to be less authentic, which led to
lowered product attitude and purchase intention. As a scenario-based
study using real brands was conducted in Study 1, Study 2 utilizes
product image stimuli and a fictitious brand.

4.2. Results
4.2.1. Measurement testing
The validity and reliability of the measurement were tested by
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with maximum-likelihood estimation
using SPSS AMOS. The measurement model fit was adequate (χ2 =
78.86, df = 49; χ2/df = 1.61; CFI = 0.98; NNFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.07;
SRMR = 0.03). Construct validity was confirmed as all standardized
factor loadings were high and significant at a p-value of .001 (see
Table 1). Discriminant validity was achieved as all average variance
extracted (AVE) of the constructs were larger than the squared corre­
lations. Cronbach’s alpha (α>0.91) and composite reliability (CR>0.92)
were larger than the general threshold of 0.70, supporting reliability.
The results of measurement model testing are in Appendix E.

5.1. Methods
5.1.1. Study design and procedure
A single-factor (design entity: AI vs. human) between-subject online
experiment was conducted. One hundred and eighty U.S. participants
were recruited from Amazon Mturk. After deleting those who failed the
multiple attention check questions, 161 participants remained for
further analysis (Mage = 36.88, SDage = 10.69; 67.7% male; see Ap­
pendix B and C). Similar to Study 1, shopping scenarios manipulated the
design entity. Participants were randomly given one of the two shopping
scenarios, viewed a product image, and completed the questionnaire.

(p = .126) and brand familiarity (p = .575) between the two brands.

The scenario asked them to imagine that they found a sweater designed
by either Artificial Intelligence (AI) or fashion designers online. Again, a
sweater was used in the study based on the suggestions of the past
literature and the results of pretest (DeLong et al., 1986; see 4.1.1
above). The questionnaire and a diagrammatic representation of study
procedure are available in Appendix D.

5.2. Results
5.2.1. Measurement testing
The measurement model fit was adequate (χ2 = 212.61, df = 125; χ2/
df = 1.701; CFI = 0.97; NNFI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.07; SRMR = 0.05; see
Appendix E). Construct validity was confirmed as the factor loadings
were high and significant at a p-value of .001 (see Table 1). Discriminant
validity was achieved as all AVE values of the constructs were larger
than the squared correlations. Cronbach’s alpha (α>0.85) and com­
posite reliability (CR>0.88) supported measurement reliability.

5.1.2. Stimuli
An identical product image was given to participants across the study
conditions to ensure testing of the causal effect of design entity. A pretest
(n = 72; Mage = 33.75, SDage = 10.38; 65.3% male; see Appendix C) was
conducted on Amazon Mturk to select appropriate product image stimuli
and fictitious brand name. The pretest questionnaire is available in
Appendix D. The pretest consisted of two parts. Participants were told
they would see multiple brand names and products and give their
opinions about them. First, participants were given a list of six fictitious
brand names which were created using an online fake brand name
generator. For each brand name, brand attitude and brand familiarity
were measured using single-item scales: “To what extent do you feel
positive or negative about these fashion brand names?” (1 = Extremely
negative–7 = Extremely positive) and “To what extent are you familiar
with the following fashion brand names?” (1 = Extremely unfamiliar–7 =
Extremely familiar). Next, participants viewed four clothing images in
random order: pique shirt, sweater, shirt, and jacket. For each product
image, product attitude was measured using three-item semantic dif­
ferential scales: negative–positive, dislikable–likable, and bad–good
(0.85<α<0.90).
A fictitious brand name ‘Camource’ were chosen because partici­
pants showed relatively neutral attitudes toward the brand name (M =
4.56, SD = 1.45) and low brand familiarity (M = 4.26, SD = 1.88),
compared to other brand names. Next, a sweater image was selected as
final because participants showed neutral attitudes toward the sweater
compared to other products (M = 4.92, SD = 1.47).

5.2.2. Effect of design entity
MANCOVA was performed with brand familiarity, perceived threats
from AI, and product involvement as covariates. All three covariates
showed significant correlations with at least one dependent variable and
showed a significant effect (brand familiarity, product involvement: p <
.001; perceived threats: p = .040). The statistical assumptions of the
methods used were met (see Appendix F). The main effect of design
entity was significant (Pillai’s Λ = 0.09, Wilks’ λ = 0.90, p = .012, η2 =
0.09). The results were generally sustained sans covariates, showing
minimal changes in statistics values1 (see Appendix G). Participants
perceived higher authenticity from the human-designed (vs. AIdesigned) sweater (MAI = 5.19 vs. Mhuman = 5.60; F = 8.80, p = .003,
η2 = 0.06), consistent with Study 1 results. Compared to the AI-designed
sweater, the human-designed sweater was perceived to be of marginally
significantly higher quality (MAI = 5.52 vs. Mhuman = 5.75; F = 3.49, p =
.064, η2 = 0.02). Participants in the human-designed condition formed
more favorable attitudes toward the sweater (MAI = 5.02 vs. Mhuman =
5.39; F = 4.94, p = .028, η2 = 0.03) and the brand (MAI = 4.93 vs.
Mhuman = 5.27; F = 4.20, p = .042, η2 = 0.03). No significant difference
was found in purchase intention between the human-designed and the
AI-designed conditions (p = .837). Thus, H1 was partially supported for
product attitude and brand attitude, but not for purchase intention.

5.1.3. Measurements
The multi-item scales were drawn from the literature and modified
(see Table 1). Perceived authenticity was measured using the same items
used in Study 1. Expected product quality was measured using Sweeney
et al.’s (1999) items which represent participants’ evaluation of quality
value of the product. Product attitude (Rajagopal and Montgomery,
2012) and purchase intention (Singh and Cole, 1993) were measured
using other sets of well-established scales. Because Study 2 used ficti­
tious brands, brand attitude was measured using the two items (Mitch­
ell, 1986) and used as a dependent variable. Harman’s one-factor test
confirmed the absence of common method bias (total variance extrac­
ted: 39.76%).

5.2.3. Mediation
PROCESS Model 4 was performed with brand familiarity, perceived
threats from AI, and product involvement as covariates. The approach of
performing model 4 first was to test the mediation of perceived
authenticity and examine H2 thoroughly in a different study context.
Consistent with Study 1, the indirect effects of design entity through
perceived authenticity were significant on product attitude (b = 0.28, CI
= [0.0853, 0.5131]), purchase intention (b = 0.31, CI = [0.0984,
0.5508]), and brand attitude (b = 0.19, CI = [0.0481, 0.3909]). Thus,
H2 was again supported.
Next, Model 6 tested the serial mediation of perceived authenticity
and expected quality simultaneously to answer H3. Fig. 3 and Table 2
shows the results of the serial mediation analysis on the effect of design
entity. The indirect effects of design entity serially through perceived
authenticity and expected product quality were significant on product
attitude (b = 0.09, CI = [0.0242, 0.1898]), purchase intention (b = 0.13,
CI = [0.0326, 0.2758]), and brand attitude (b = 0.10, CI = [0.0283,
0.2080]). The sole mediation of perceived authenticity remained sig­
nificant for product attitude and purchase intention, indicating that both
perceived authenticity and the authenticity–product quality chain
mediate the effect of design entity on the two. Thus, H3 was supported.

5.1.4. Covariates
Brand attitude was not considered a covariate in Study 2 because
Study 2 used a fictitious brand name, and the pre-existing attitude was
not a major concern (Schneider and Cornwell, 2005). Rather, brand
attitude was entered as a dependent variable to examine if design entity
affects brand attitude. Brand familiarity (Batra et al., 2000; α = 0.98)
was still measured as a potential covariate to control potential influence
of the feeling of knowing the brand. Next, perceived threats from AI
(White et al., 2012; α = 0.96) were measured because the literature
suggested the feeling of being threatened by novel technology can make
people negatively respond to outcomes produced by the technology
(Khasawneh, 2018). Lastly, product involvement (Zaichkowsky, 1985;
α = 0.96) was measured as a potential covariate. This was because a
sweater image was used as a stimulus, and one’s interest levels in
sweaters might provoke confounding effects on the evaluation of the
products (Richins and Bloch, 1986).

5.3. Discussion
Study 2 aimed to replicate Study 1 using a fictitious brand and a
product image. Study 2 showed consistent results with Study 1 such that

6.1. Methods
6.1.1. Study design and procedure
A single-factor (AI design process: AI vs. AI customization) betweensubject online experiment was conducted to test the effect of providing
real-time customization options in the AI design process. One hundred
and sixty U.S. participants fluent in English were recruited from Prolific,
and 156 participants remained for data analysis (Mage = 37.50, SDage =
13.26; 38.5% male; see Appendix B and C). The AI design process was
manipulated through shopping scenarios and customization tasks. Par­
ticipants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. Those in
the AI condition read a scenario and viewed a product image. The sce­
nario told them AI designed a sweater. Participants in the AI custom­
ization condition read a scenario telling them AI would design a sweater
based on their input. They were given options to select the sweater’s
color and pattern, and a product image based on their input was then
provided to them. This approach was adopted to ensure internal validity
by minimizing the potential differences between diverse stimuli caused
by user-typed prompts. The questionnaire and a diagrammatic repre­
sentation of study procedure are available in Appendix D.
6.1.2. Stimuli
The sweater image used in Study 2 was used in Study 3. Sixteen
variations of the sweater image were developed to reflect the design
options in the AI customization condition: four colors (light gray, gray,
light blue, and blue) and four patterns (no pattern; plain, argyle, stipe,
and dot). To avoid potential confounding effects of sweater design be­
tween study conditions and increase internal validity, the same set of
sweater images available in the AI customization condition was used in
the AI condition to show a randomly selected image.

Note. Asterisk (*) indicates significant effect.

participants formed more favorable attitudes toward human-designed
(vs. AI-designed) clothing because of perceived authenticity (H1, H2).
The effect was also significant on brand attitude, but not on purchase
intention or expected product quality. In contrast to the scenario-based
experiment in Study 1, the insignificant differences in purchase inten­
tion between the study conditions may be due to the product image
stimuli used in Study 2. Additionally, Study 2 confirmed the serial
mediation of perceived authenticity and expected product quality be­
tween design entity (AI vs. human) and the three consumer responses
(H3). Although the perceived authenticity–product quality chain
explained the effect of design entity, the mediation of perceived
authenticity still remained significant. Next, Study 3 examines the role
of AI customization in alleviating consumers’ negative responses to AIdesigned clothing by testing the effect of AI design process.

6.1.3. Measurements
The scales used in Study 2 were used to measure perceived authen­
ticity, expected product quality, product attitude, purchase intention,
and brand attitude (see Table 1). Additionally, perceived automation
and customization in design were measured to check similar perceived
automation and different perceived customization between the study
conditions. Participants indicated perceived automation in design by
specifying the extent to which the design process seemed more like (1 =
mostly by computer—10 = mostly by humans). Perceived customization
was measured by employing the items from Srinivasan et al.’s (2002)
study on a 7-point Likert scale (α = 0.93): “This sweater design was
customized to my needs,” “I believe that this sweater design was
customized to my characteristics,” and “This sweater was designed
based on my input.” Harman’s one-factor test confirmed the absence of

common method bias (total variance extracted: 34.70%).

indicating that the effects of AI design process are partially mediated by
perceived authenticity and the authenticity–product quality chain.
Thus, H3 is supported in the context of AI design process.

6.1.4. Covariates
Similar to Study 2, brand familiarity (α = 0.98), perceived threats
from AI (α = 0.92), and product involvement (α = 0.95) were measured
as the potential covariates using the same measurements.

6.3. Discussion
Study 3 confirmed the role of AI customization in mitigating the
negative effect of AI as design entity by comparing AI versus AI cus­
tomization (H4). Participants’ negative attitudes and purchase in­
tentions toward AI-designed clothing were mitigated when they
provided their input to customize the product design. While expected
product quality did not differ, Study 3 confirmed the mediation of
perceived authenticity (H2) and the serial mediation of perceived
authenticity and expected product quality (H3) when comparing AI
versus AI customization. In line with Study 2, the mediation of perceived
authenticity remained significant when the perceived authenticity–­
product quality chain was entered. Unexpectedly, the direct effect of AI
design process on the responses was found to be significant, suggesting
that a third factor may explain such a relationship. The following sec­
tions present a general discussion of the study findings along with
theoretical and practical implications.

6.2. Results
6.2.1. Measurement testing
The measurement model fit was adequate (χ2 = 264.01, df = 141; χ2/
df = 1.872; CFI = 0.97; NNFI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.07; SRMR = 0.05; see
Appendix E). Construct validity was confirmed as the factor loadings
were high and significant at a p-value of .001 (see Table 1). Discriminant
validity was achieved as all AVE values of the constructs were larger
than the squared correlations. Cronbach’s alpha (α>0.88) and com­
posite reliability (CR>0.88) supported measurement reliability.
6.2.2. Effect of AI design process
There were no differences in perceived automation between the two
study conditions (p = .487). Compared to those in the AI condition,
participants in the AI customization condition believed more that the
sweater was designed with customization (M = 2.62 vs. 5.13; t = -11.31,
p < .001). Thus, the manipulation of AI design process was successful.
MANCOVA was performed with brand familiarity, perceived threats
from AI, and product involvement as covariates. The three covariates
showed significant correlations with at least one dependent variable and
showed a significant effect (perceived threats, product involvement: p <
.001; brand familiarity: p = .003). The statistical assumptions were met
(see Appendix F). The main effect of the AI design process was signifi­
cant (Pillai’s Λ = 0.18, Wilks’ λ = 0.82, p < .001, η2 = 0.18). The results
were generally sustained sans covariates, showing minimal changes in
statistics values2 (see Appendix G). Participants in the AI customization
(vs. AI) condition perceived higher authenticity (MAI = 3.91 vs. MAI­
2
custom = 4.32; F = 4.81, p = .030, η = 0.03). Also, participants in the AI
customization (vs. AI) condition formed higher product attitude (MAI =
3.84 vs. MAIcustom = 4.70; F = 12.65, p < .001, η2 = 0.08), purchase
intention (MAI = 2.52 vs. MAIcustom = 3.87; F = 29.79, p < .001, η2 =
0.17), and brand attitude (MAI = 4.05 vs. MAIcustom = 4.65; F = 9.18, p =
.003, η2 = 0.06). Expected product quality between the two conditions
did not differ (p = .353). Thus, H4 was supported for all variables except
for expected quality.

7. General discussion
The huge progress in generative AI, an algorithm-based computer
system that enables new content creation, is clearly bringing revolutions
to retail and consumer environment. Companies adopt AI-assisted
product design processes to optimize overall operations and improve
efficiency while better meeting market demand. To provide a theorybased understanding of AI-designed clothing from the consumer psy­
chology perspective, this study investigated how consumers respond to
AI-designed fashion products, focusing on clothing.
The findings indicate that consumers generally form negative re­
sponses to AI-designed (vs. human-designed) clothing. This pattern is
attributed to low perceived authenticity from AI, which is based on the
large discrepancy between consumers’ preexisting fashion design
schema and AI. Further, the authenticity–product quality chain also
explains consumer responses to fashion products designed by AI versus
humans. AI versus humans as design entity does not always lead to
significantly different expected product quality. Still, they serially
explain the effect on consumer responses because perceived authenticity
positively affects expected product quality. Finally, the findings confirm
the role of AI customization. Although consumers form negative bias
regarding the authenticity of AI-designed clothing, such bias against AIassisted design processes can be attenuated through the option to
customize their own product design. Consequently, consumers’ attitudes
and purchase intentions toward clothing designed through AI custom­
ization become more positive compared to non-AI-customization.
Perceived authenticity increased through AI customization in turn im­
proves expected product quality, making them serially explain the effect
of AI customization.

6.2.3. Mediation
PROCESS Model 4 was performed with brand familiarity, perceived
threats from AI, and product involvement as covariates. The indirect
effects of the AI design process through perceived authenticity were
significant on product attitude (b = 0.32, CI = [0.0362, 0.6244]), pur­
chase intention (b = 0.28, CI = [0.0334, 0.5444]), and brand attitude (b
= 0.28, CI = [0.0261, 0.5465]). Thus, the mediation of perceived
authenticity was confirmed in the context of AI design process.
Model 6 was performed to test the serial mediation. Fig. 4 and
Table 3 shows the results of the serial mediation analysis. The indirect
effects of AI design process through perceived authenticity and expected
quality were significant on product attitude (b = 0.06, CI = [0.0015,
0.1445]), purchase intention (b = 0.06, CI = [0.0032, 0.1488]), and
brand attitude (b = 0.07, CI = [0.0067, 0.1639]). The sole mediation of
perceived authenticity still remained large and significant for all three
dependent variables. In addition, the direct effects of AI design process
on the responses were significant after specifying the serial mediations,

7.1. Implications
This study contributes to the literature by providing theoretical im­
plications on consumer responses to fashion products designed through
the AI-assisted process. First, this study helps advance the knowledge of
AI-assisted design processes in the consumer environment by demon­
strating consumers’ negative biases against to AI-designed (humandesigned) clothing. These findings align with the studies that humangenerated (vs. AI-generated) fashion design is more favorably evalu­
ated (Lee, 2022; Xu and Mehta, 2022). Furthermore, extending the
findings to marketing outcomes, the current study found that the
negative responses to AI-designed clothing may or may not impact sales
revenue by lowering purchase intention. These findings have the po­
tential to describe the discrepancy in the literature that consumers form

authenticity and expected product quality also explain the benefits of AI
customization.
Third, this study contributes to the question of how negative bias
against AI-designed clothing can be attenuated. The findings empirically
reveal that AI customization, the process where AI generates designs
based on consumers’ real-time personalization of their product design, is
effective in raising perceived authenticity and thus drawing more pos­
itive consumer attitudes and intentions. These findings extend the pre­
vious research on the benefits of mass customization or customer
involvement (Moreau and Herd, 2010; Nishikawa et al., 2013; Stevens
et al., 2017) to AI design process. Notably, the relationship between
personalization and perceived authenticity is proven in the context of AI
customization.
The findings have important implications for practitioners who
adopt generative AI in the product design process. First, practitioners
can have insights into how and why consumers would negatively eval­
uate AI-designed clothing compared to human-designed clothing.
Considering that fashion design schema is established based on previ­
ously accumulated information revolving around fashion design, it may
be beneficial to first target the young generations who are deemed
digital natives and more familiar with advanced technology when pro­
moting AI-assisted design. Rather than pursuing a short-term increase in
sales through AI-assisted design processes, the long-term business goal
of helping consumers become more familiar with AI as a design entity
will be needed. More importantly, as perceived authenticity and ex­
pected product quality explain the negative evaluations, practitioners
can focus on enhancing and emphasizing the uniqueness of fashion
design generated through AI-assisted design processes.
Second, this study offers practitioners valuable insights regarding the
benefits of AI customization for making consumers more favorably
respond to fashion products designed with AI-assisted processes. AI
customization is suggested as a customer-centric way to better align
with the consumers’ ever-growing and changing needs while sustaining
the fashion design innovation driven by generative AI. Practitioners can
maintain computer-aided customization systems that are available to
individual consumers to compensate for the decreased perceived
authenticity and mitigate negative responses to AI-designed clothing.
For example, brands can produce designated product lines exploiting a
range of design options that consumers can use for their AI custom­
ization and increase the perceived authenticity of the AI-customized
product. Nevertheless, further efforts will be inevitable to overcome
the challenges in adapting the AI customization as the production dif­
ficulty increases with customization (Aggarwal et al., 2020).
Some implications for policymakers regarding AI design can be
considered based on the findings and the topic of this research, although
the study findings provide meaningful implications mainly for re­
searchers and practitioners. First, a guideline that companies utilizing AI

negative responses but may be willing to pay more due to its novelty for
AI-designed products. While it is beyond the current study’s scope, it
will be interesting if future research explores which design aspects of AI
versus human-designed clothing differentially affects purchase intention
and willingness to pay more.
Second, this study unveils the mechanisms under the negative re­
sponses to AI-designed clothing building on the schema theory. Because
consumers’ schemata about fashion design are mainly associated with
human work and traits, clothing designed by AI that uses existing data is
perceived as less genuine or authentic. Consequently, perceived
authenticity formed by the information about design entity shapes ex­
pected product quality and thus explains negative attitudes and pur­
chase intentions. Extending the previous findings on schema,
authenticity, and product quality perception to AI-assisted design pro­
cesses (e.g., Bem, 1981; Cinelli and LeBoeuf, 2020; Halkias and Kokki­
naki, 2014; Meyers-Levy and Tybout, 1989; Rao and Monroe, 1989), the
current study shows that fashion design schemata explain how and why
consumers evaluate AI-designed clothing. Furthermore, perceived

design clearly disclose the use of AI is deemed to be important. Since
consumers do not see AI-designed clothing as sincere and authentic as
human-designed clothing, not sharing information about AI usage in the
product design process can lead to a potential discussion about con­
sumer deception. Second, as AI customization options become more
accessible to consumers, a policy to monitor consumers’ unethical AI
usage for product design can be discussed. Nevertheless, future research
is needed to dig into the policy implications as the objective of the
current study is not to provide a full, detailed picture for policy
implications.

7.2. Limitations and future research
The current study is among the first to conduct a theory-based study
exploring consumer responses to AI-designed fashion products. Still,
several study limitations remain, which can be considered in future
research. First, AI customization design process can be operationalized
in different ways other than customizing colors and patterns for
sweaters. Arising platforms for product customization using generative
AI provide diverse customization options to incorporate customers’
input, including selecting or typing in not only certain design compo­
nents (e.g., colors or patterns) but also materials (e.g., cotton or linen),
trims (e.g., buttons), features (e.g., pockets), or adjectives (e.g., fash­
ionable). Further, this study used a sweater image to control product
category effects. It will be interesting to test how perceptions of AIdesigned clothing vary depending on product categories (e.g., coat,
dress, leggings).
Second, the current study developed the hypotheses building upon
schema theory, focusing on the influence of schemata on product per­
ceptions (i.e., perceived authenticity and product quality). Given that
this study did not directly examine how AI is perceived as a design entity
from schema perspectives because it was out of scope, future research
can explore factors resulting from one’s schemata that may affect per­
ceptions of AI itself working for clothing design. It will be valuable to
test whether consumers’ particular AI schemata affect how they respond
to AI as a design entity.
Lastly, Study 3 yielded interesting findings that the effects of AI
design process are partially mediated by perceived authenticity and the
authenticity–product quality chain and that the direct effect of AI design
process on consumer responses still remains. While this study does not
entirely unveil which factor explains different responses to clothing
designed by AI versus AI customization, these findings call for future
studies employing diverse perspectives.
